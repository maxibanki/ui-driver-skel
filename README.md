## Development

This package contains a small web-server that will serve up the custom driver UI at `http://localhost:3000/component.js`.  You can run this while developing and point the Rancher settings there.
* `npm start`
* The driver name can be optionally overridden: `npm start -- --name=DRIVERNAME`
* The compiled files are viewable at http://localhost:3000.
* **Note:** The development server does not currently automatically restart when files are changed.

## Building

For other users to see your driver, you need to build it and host the output on a server accessible from their browsers.

* `npm run build`
* Copy the contents of the `dist` directory onto a webserver.
  * If your Rancher is configured to use HA or SSL, the server must also be available via HTTPS.
